What type of analytics am I performing?

Write the pipeline for that type of analytics: 

What analytical models am I doing based on my business problem and datasets?

Include necessary .py's for this stage that match the analysis pipeline,
pulling the data in from the directory you stored the processed data in the ETL stage.

Store the data in /data under etl.
