INST414 Final Project - Airport Project 

Project Overview 
My business problem involves understanding how weather and seasonal conditions correlate with flight delays and cancellation rates at different U.S. airports.
The two datasets, "U.S. Weather Events (2016-2022)" and "Predicting_Flight_Delays (2022 - US) Raw Data" provide data such as weather conditions, flight records, and delay/cancellation rates. Through descriptive analysis, including measures of frequency, central tendency, and dispersion, I aim to highlight the weather conditions and seasons associated with the highest rates of delays and cancellations. This will help airports and airlines better anticipate and manage operations during inclement weather.
