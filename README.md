INST414 Final Project - Airport Project 

# Project Overview 
#### The business problem I am addressing is to identify the relationship between specific weather conditions and their impact on flight delays at Chicago Oâ€™Hare International Airport. The two datasets, "Weather Events Data" and "Predicting_Flight_Delays (2022 - US) Raw Data" provide data such as weather events, flight records, and delay/cancellation rates. Through predictive analysis, I am evaluating the relationship between weather conditions and flight delays through a simple linear regression. This provides insights to the Weather Operations Department at Chicago O'Hare International Airport and can improve operations and preperations during inclement weather.
