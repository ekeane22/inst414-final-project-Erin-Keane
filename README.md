INST414 Final Project - Airport Project 

# Project Overview 
#### The business problem I am addressing is identifying the relationship between specific weather conditions and their impact on flight delays and cancellations at Chicago Oâ€™Hare International Airport. The two datasets, "Weather Events Data" and "Predicting_Flight_Delays (2022 - US) Raw Data" provide data such as weather events, flight records, and delay/cancellation rates. Through predictive analysis, I aim to highlight the relationship between weather conditions and delays and cancellations through a simple linear regression. This will help airports and airlines better anticipate and manage operations during inclement weather.
