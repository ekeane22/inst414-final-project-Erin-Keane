'''
Write code to pull the data in from the file that the csv was stored in. 
This is /data under etl. 
This involves making decisions and handling missing values, duplicates, consistent attribute naming, 
robust unique IDs, tidying and normalizing data, joining and merging datasets. Remember that the goal 
is to maintain the integrity of the data and transform it into analytical data.

In this .py, I need to make edits to the csv's, one of the .csv's includes lots of rows and columns I dont need.
